# OpenGrok-Tooltip-Tweak

this is a simple JS script, to add Tooltips to all kinds of symbol names in a page (functions, macros, locals, globals) with their definition.

TODO:
1. the main thing i need to do - make it server sided (instead of js tweak) and commit it to the main OpenGrok project
2. add support for multi-lined functions (probably using regex)
